RAcE-factors-in-non-use-of-iCCM
The primary outcome of interest for this study will be the reported utilization of the CHW by a caregiver of an under-five child sick with diarrhoea, fever, and/or suspected pneumonia in the two weeks preceding an interview.  

Three possible outcomes for childhood illnesses will be considered: not seeking appropriate care, seeking care from iCCM sources, or seeking care from other appropriate sources. 

The baseline care-seeking outcomes from the Baseline Survey will be compared with the care-seeking out-comes the endline survey in 2017.  

Those not seeking appropriate care will be assessed for Demographic, HH decisions, CG knowledge, perceptions, reasons for no careseeking.  

A key independent variable of interest is the residence of the caregiver and child in the village with a CHW providing routine iCCM services.
